# Animations
This Application called `Animations` contains cool 2D Animations that have been written in the Coding Train as Challange.  
All these Animations have been rewritten in Kotlin/JVM. For the Animations I used the Processing Core Library.

# AnimationsUI
AnimationsUI is a simple UI to start Animations.  
To run the UI you need to add the `-ui` tag: `java -jar Animations.jar -ui`. Without the tag, the application starts in CLI mode

# Processing Core
The Processing Core I used is the one shipped with Processing 3.4 on Ubuntu.  
The Core is not included in this Repository, only referenced in the `.idea/libraries/Processing.xml` file as `processing-340-core.jar`.

# ControlP5
For the AnimationUi I used ControlP5 2.2.6  
ControlP5 is not included in this Repository, only referenced in the `.idea/libraries/Processing.xml` file as `controlP5-226.jar`

# Contribute
Make changes, add new Animations (2D only, 3D needs Native libraries and that can cause issues) or do what ever you want.
