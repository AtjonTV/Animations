# Animations
This Application called `Animations` contains cool 2D Animations that have been written in the Coding Train as Challange.  
All these Animations have been rewritten in Kotlin/JVM. For the Animations I used the Processing Core Library.

# Processing Core
The Processing Core I used is the one shipped with Processing 3.4 on Ubuntu.  
The Core is not included in this Repository, only referenced in the `.idea/libraries/KotlinJavaRuntime.xml` file as `processing-340-core.jar`.

I provide my Kotlin version of the Original Java (Processing) version with the MIT License.

Feel free to contribute under the terms of MIT.

# Contribute
Make changes, add new Animations (2D only, 3D needs Native libraries and that can cause issues) or do what ever you want.
